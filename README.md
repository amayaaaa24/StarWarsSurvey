# StarWarsSurvey

In this project, we want to answer the question "Do people consider 'The Empire Strikes Back' as the best movie in the Star Wars series?", which is raised by the team at FiveThirtyEight. Based on the average rankings and the number of viewers for different episodes, we found a positive answer to this question. We also divide the data into different groups and found that the views of the fans are different from those of non-fans, and that the Star Wars Movies attract more male viewers than female viewers.

For further information about the project, please refer to the `StarWarsSurvey.ipynb` file, where you can find all the relevant details.
